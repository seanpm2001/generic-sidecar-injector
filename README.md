## Overview
When working with Kubernetes, engineers often need to add a sidecar container to a pod for various reasons, scrape metrics or logs at scale, debug network issues or apply networking configurations, without having to add complexity, additional logic and configuration to the application.

For a Kubernetes cluster with several services, it becomes a hassle having to add the sidecar container configuration to all services. In addition, it also makes the manifest file harder to read by a human.

To solve this problem, we introduce a generic sidecar injector, where it injects a sidecar container to a pod based on a specific annotation added to the service manifest.
